#Below are some fun and simple warm-up Python problems.
#These are meant to get you more comfortable with Python syntax.
#Use https://cse.taylor.edu/~mtoth/basicPython.html for help.

#Directions for use:
#   Along with this file, have 'tester.py' open (I suggest split screening them)
#   Go ahead and run 'tester.py' and leave it running.
#   Type in your solutions below, save the new changes, then follow the
#       tester's prompts.
#   You can test your solutions as much as you want.
#   The tester will try your solutions against hundreds of test cases,
#       including edge cases.





#Warm-up 1
#Return whether or not num is equal to -3.
#ex: num=-3 should return True; num=4 should return False
def W1_isNegativeThree(num):
    pass



#Warm-up 2
#Return True if the given word is 6 characters long, False otherwise.
def W2_isSixCharactersLong(word):
    pass



#Warm-up 3
#Return the string "That's expensive!" if the cost is over 200.
#Return the string "That's dirt cheap!" if the cost is 200 or less.
def W3_howExpensive(cost):
    pass



#Warm-up 4
#Like before, return the string "That's expensive!" if the cost is over 200.
#But now, return the string "That's dirt cheap!" only if the cost is below 200.
#If the cost is exactly 200, return "That's a fair price!"
#If the cost is negative, return "That's a steal!"
def W4_howExpensive2(cost):
    pass



#Warm-up 5
#You will buy a certain product only if it costs 4 or less.
#However, if you consider the product to be "essential", then you will
#   buy it no matter what the cost is.
#The cost is given by 'cost', and 'essential' is either True or False.
#Return True if you would buy the product, False otherwise.
def W5_toBuyOrNotToBuy(cost, essential):
    pass



#Warm-up 6
#Return the last element in the given array.
def W6_lastElement(arr):
    pass



#Warm-up 7
#Return True if the given 'item' is in the array, False otherwise.
#Note: The 'in' operator does this exact thing, making for a simple solution:
#   'return (item in arr)'
#But you are not allowed to use this. There are other ways!
def W7_isItemInArray(arr, item):
    pass



#Warm-up 8
#Given an array of numbers, return the sum of its contents.
#However, you cannot use the built-in 'sum' function!
def W8_sumTheContents(arr):
    pass



#Warm-up 9
#Return a greeting that uses 'myName' and 'yourName'.
#For example, given myName="Bob" and yourName="John", the greeting
#   should take the form: "Hello John! My name is Bob. Nice to meet you."
def W9_stringGreeting(myName, yourName):
    pass



#Warm-up 10
#Return an array that contains a, b, and c, in that order, and nothing else.
def W10_buildArray(a, b, c):
    pass
