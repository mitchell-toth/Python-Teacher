#Below are some fun and semi-challenging Python problems. Enjoy!
#Use https://cse.taylor.edu/~mtoth/basicPython.html for help.

#Directions for use:
#   Along with this file, have 'tester.py' open (I suggest split screening them)
#   Go ahead and run 'tester.py' and leave it running.
#   Type in your solutions below, save the new changes, then follow the
#       tester's prompts.
#   You can test your solutions as much as you want.
#   The tester will try your solutions against hundreds of test cases,
#       including edge cases.





#Challenge 1
#Given two numbers 'a' and 'b', return the larger of the two.
#If the two numbers are the same, return a-b.
def C1_returnTheLarger(a, b):
    pass



#Challenge 2
#Given array 'arr', return 'arr' with all of the elements arranged in reverse order.
#You cannot use the .reverse() method for arrays.
def C2_reverseArray(arr):
    pass



#Challenge 3
#Given a word, return True if it is a palindrome (the same forwards as backwards),
#and False otherwise.
def C3_isPalindrome(word):
    pass



#Challenge 4
#Given a number, sum up and return all the odd-placed numbers within it.
#Ex: number = 1234. The desired sum is 2 + 4 = 6.
#Start your count at 0, like a true programmer. So in this example...
#1 is at the 0th place, 2 at the 1st place, 3 at the 2nd place, 4 at the 3rd place.
def C4_addAllOdds(number):
    pass



#Challenge 5
#Implement a game of rock, paper, scissors!
#Given p1 and p2, determine who wins, if there's a tie, or if one of the
#   players is invalid.
#rock > scissors, paper > rock, and scissors > paper.
#You are to return one of the following messages:
#   ex: p1=rock, p2=scissors --> "rock beats scissors!"
#   when there's a tie --> "Tie game!"
#   when at least one player is invalid (not rock, paper, or
#       scissors) --> "Invalid player!"
def C5_rockPaperScissors(p1, p2):
    pass



#Challenge 6
#Given a string, return how many times the word "code" appears in it.
#But, to make it trickier, any letter can replace the "d" in "code".
#So "cope", "cooe", and "coze" would all count toward the total.
def C6_countCode(string):
    pass
